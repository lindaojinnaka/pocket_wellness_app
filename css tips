1. How to use Inline- go inside the element and write style="color:red;"
  Syntax for changing the color of border a<h1 style="color: blue; border: 3px solid green"> Welcome to Fela Kuti's page! </h1> 
  (you can change solid to dotted.)
  Inline not really recommended because you will have to go and individually change elements.

2. Internal CSS-within the head, add an internal style sheet
(under title)
<style>
h1 {
    color:purple;
}
h2 {
    color:orange;
<style>
}
